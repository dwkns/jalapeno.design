## Background

The client was developing a new minimally invasived method of treating Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR) of the heart by placing a series of pledgets pairs into the annulus of the mitral valve, and then tightening them so the heart valves would seal better. 

Their device offered a novel percutaneous tricuspid valve annuloplasty technique, which aims to reduce tricuspid annular dilatation in functional TR by delivering and cinching two pledgeted sutures to the posterior portion of the tricuspid annulus via transjugular access.

TR represents an important unmet need in clinical cardiology given its prevalence, adverse prognostic impact and symptom burden associated with progressive right heart failure.

## Problem

Safety and usability was a huge factor in the design, with each device needing multiple safety interlocks before cutting the suture and releasing the pledgets.

As the surgery involved multiple steps there was a requirement for a series of custom handles to aid the surgeon during the procedure. Each handle would be used for a certain step, and then the next handle for the next step.

We were involved in 5 steps:

* Navigating to the correct area of the heart (which is still beating during the procedure)
* Placing the pledgets
* Tensioning the suture holding pairs of pledgets
* Placing a locking device
* Cutting the suture

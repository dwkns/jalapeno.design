## Background
A cardiologist from Harvard Medical School had come up with a novel way of treating problems with the flow of blood through the chambers of the heart by using a minimally invasive catheter that could increase the length of the chordae that control the closing of the heart valve leaflets. 

We were tasked with coming up with a clamp and delivery method for the clamps that would allow then to be attached to the chordae, and then have the distance between the anchors adjusted, and then finally cutting the chordae so the valve could close properly. This was all to be done without stopping the heart.

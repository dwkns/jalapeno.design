## Background

Dualit is a companyy that makes consumer and commercial kitchen equipment. The tooling for the end caps was tradionally made by hand, but when Dualit decided to modernize their manufacturing processes they wanted a more curvy appearance.

## Services

We went through multiple iterations to get the curve just right, which meant printing and getting prototypes chrome plated so we could check the reflections.
